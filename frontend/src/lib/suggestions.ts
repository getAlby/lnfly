3. Do a request to the backend, passing the user's choice and their invoice. The backend will use NWC to generate a 21 sat invoice and return it as the response.
4. The user must pay the invoice using their connected wallet.
5. Once the invoice is paid, begin polling a different endpoint on the backend once every 3 seconds. The invoice must be passed in the request. This endpoint will check if the invoice was paid, and if it was paid, flip the coin and return the result. If the user guessed correctly, the backend should also pay the user's invoice they provided.
6. In the frontend, if a result is returned from the polling endpoint, check if it matches the user's choice. If so, show some confetti and "You guessed correctly! Enjoy the 42 sats!", otherwise show "you guessed incorrectly".`,

Add a small "view previous links" button below. This will show the links and the price paid. For the latest link, show ??? rather than the actual URL.
